## Calculate Openings and Closings of a Scissor

Our task is to figure out how many times scissor was used at a manufacturing plant. Imagine we have used a computer vision model which returns us the frame by frame data on how the scissors are moving.

1. It returns three sets of coordinates (x, y): **center**, **top**, **bottom**.
2. **Closed Threshold**: When top and bottom blades are below this threshold, we assume scissors are closed. You can decide how you want to define this value, and justify why you chose it.
3. **Open Threshold**: When top and bottom blades are beyong this threshold, we assume scissors are opened. You can decide how you want to define this value, and justify why you chose it.

### Algorithm and Examples

There are few frames files provided in `frames` folder. We shall run algorithm one by one on each of these files. Each file represents series of coordinates for the three keypoints, and the task is to calculate the number of times scissors were opened and closed. Here are some examples to clarify the different cases:

### Questions to think about (No code needed)

#### Feel free to write small answers for them below

Besides these examples, there are a lot of other cases how the data could be collect, for example, they data captured could be zoomed in, or zoomed out.

1. What would be the other different orientations/cases that are possible?
2. How would you update your algorithm (if you need to) for these new cases in (1)
3. For testing purposes, if you had to generate frames data, how would you go about it?
